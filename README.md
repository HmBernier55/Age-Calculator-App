## **_Purpose:_**

Practicing my Front-End Development skills using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## **_Description:_**

My interpretation of a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) Challenge

- Calculates how much time has past (in years, months, and days) since an inputted date and displays the result on the screen
- Runs validation on the inputs:
  - Each input must have a value
  - Each input must be a number
  - The day input cannot surpass 31 and must have 2 numbers
  - The month input cannot surpass 12 and must have 2 numbers
  - The year input must have 4 numbers
  - Date entered must be a plausible date
    - Ex: 04/31/2023 is not plausible because there is not 31 days in April
  - Date entered must be in the past
- An error will show underneath the inputs if any of these validations are not passed
